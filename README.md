# Coin-Toss
Heads or Tails
Instructions: 
A virtual coin toss program. It will randomly tell the user "Heads" or "Tails".

Important, the first letter is capitalised and spelt exactly like in the example e.g. Heads, not heads.

There are many ways of doing this. But here I generated a random number, either 0 or 1. Then used that number to print out Heads or Tails.

e.g.
1 means Heads
0 means Tails
